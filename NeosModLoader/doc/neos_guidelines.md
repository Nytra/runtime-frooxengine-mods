## Is Modding Neos Allowed?

Yes!

On January 11, 2022, an official [Mod & Plugin Policy] was released. Mods are now officially allowed, so long as the policy is followed.

## Is Modding Good for Neos?

My opinion is yes, mods are healthy for the game. You might have deduced this from the fact that I created a mod loader. But let's look at the pros and cons, and I'll try to be impartial.

### The Pros

- Tomorrow's quality of life improvements, today. Sometimes the Neos team needs to direct their efforts elsewhere. Allowing the community to make temporary fixes pending a permanent solution is an easy win. Example: [MotionBlurDisable](https://github.com/zkxs/MotionBlurDisable), which won't be implemented in Neos until a full Settings redesign.
- Mods let power users opt in to warranty-voiding tools. Sometimes a desired feature has a very niche audience and risks breaking in the future. But at the same time it can be very useful in the present. Example: [ExportNeosToJson](https://github.com/zkxs/ExportNeosToJson).
- The classic "if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns" argument. Example: \[redacted\].
<!-- - Potential to improve the game. If the planets align, what was once a mod could be integrated into the game proper. But let's be honest, it's going to be easier for Froox to build the feature himself than porting some random garbage code in from a mod... -->
<!-- - Possible source of new developers. If you're hiring someone to program for Neos... why not hire someone who's *already* programming for Neos? -->

### The Cons

- Risk of abuse. The more control users have over the game the more damage they can potentially do.
- Risk of breakage. Users *should* be aware that mods void the warranty, but some people might complain in the wrong channels when mods break. And if things go very wrong there's potential for a mod to break an unmodified user over the network.
- Misdirection of effort. If mods create a problem the Neos team has to step in and solve that's less time spent improving the game.
<!-- - IP ramifications. Modding is a slippery slope to decompiling when the complete lack of documentation leaves you in the dark. But the same can be said for regular plugins. -->
