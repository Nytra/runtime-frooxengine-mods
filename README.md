# Do Not Use This (yet)

This is still work in progress. If you use it before it's ready I'm going to give you a very stern, disapproving look.

# Runtime's Resonite Mods

This is a collection of my mods for Resonite. See each mod's subdirectory for its readme.
## Building

- Build individual sub-projects with `dotnet build -c Release .\TrackerIdStabilizer\TrackerIdStabilizer.csproj`
- Build everything with `dotnet build -c Release all-mods.csproj`
- Your IDE might be mad until you `dotnet build -c Debug all-mods.csproj`

## License

- Top-level build-config and documentation are provided under the GPL-3.0 license.
- Each mod has a license in its own subdirectory.
