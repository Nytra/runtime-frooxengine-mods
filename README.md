# NeosVoiceQuality

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that allows you to easily change your own voice stream's bitrate.

It has two configs:
- **bitrate**: The bitrate to use for all of your audio streams. Changing this will immediately update your bitrate in *all* worlds you're in, including unfocused worlds.
- **autoset**: If true, your bitrate will be automatically updated to your configured value upon joining new worlds.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [VoiceQuality.dll](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosVoiceQuality/releases/latest/download/VoiceQuality.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
